👋 Hi, I'm Simon Frühauf, but I usually go by Bee!

🎮 I'm a Technical Game Designer with a passion for all things technical, ranging from Arduinos and code to blueprinting. I worked at [stillalive studios](https://stillalive.games) in Innsbruck, and I previously studied at [BUAS](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies) in the Netherlands.
